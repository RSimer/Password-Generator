## Password Generator

## Overview

This was a really fun project for a couple of reasons. First, javascript is really challenging but was good to navigate through and incredibly satisfying to see things work even though the only thing that needed to be fixed was some capitilization here and there. The best part about this project was that it started to really teach me how to collaborate with others. It pushed me to reach out to colleagues and my tutor to truly understand the material and get their input on what I could do to improve my code or even get started.

## What I learned

* JavaScript basics

* math. functions

* alert, prompt, confirm, and push functions

* how to use for and if loops

* console.log and eventListener functions

# Proofs in the pudding
